"""Shared constants, result type and small helpers for the agent loop.

These lived in :mod:`opencode_py.agent.loop`. They moved here so both
``loop.py`` and its ``loop_*`` mixins can use them without importing each
other. Byte-for-byte copies of the originals; ``loop.py`` re-exports every
name, so existing imports keep working.

``MAX_STEPS`` / ``AUTO_CONTINUE_*`` are read at call time from this module, so
tests that tune them must patch ``opencode_py.agent.loop_config``.
